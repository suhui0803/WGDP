# Weighted Gaussian Deep Potential (WGDP)

WGDP introduces weighted Gaussian functions to encode atomic environments across multi-element chemical combinations. This approach eliminates the linear scaling of parameters with the number of element types and enables end-to-end feature learning within a unified deep neural network, providing an efficient and accurate framework for molecular dynamics simulations of complex multi-element materials.
